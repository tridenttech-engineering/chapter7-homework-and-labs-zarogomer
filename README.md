# These assignments directly correspond with assignments in your book. For further details and references, please refer to the approriate sections in your textbook, and if you need further clarification, please reach out.

# Lab 7-1 Stop and Analyze

1. **Read textbook pages 229 through 230. Note that your book gives instructions for setting up development tools and a development environment. Ignore those instructions. We are using Replit instead. Figure 7-38 on page 229 gives the final C++ instructions to be submitted. Please do not just copy and paste. Working through Lab 7-1 will get you used to developing, building, testing, and pushing/submitting your code**i

2. **Test the program using the same data used to desk-check the program. You can compile and run your code with the following commands:**
```
make clean
make lab7-1
./lab7-1
```
**You can also use the unit test for testing your code by running the following:** 
``` 
make test_lab7-1
./test_files/test_lab7-1
```

3. **When you are done, push your code to the Github classroom. A Github Action will grade your lab.**


# Lab 7-2 Plan and Create

1. **Read textbook pages 230 through 233. Note that your book gives instructions for setting up development tools and a development environment. Ignore those instructions. We are using Replit instead. Figure 7-44 on page 233 gives the final C++ instructions to be submitted. Please do not just copy and paste. Working through Lab 7-1 will get you used to developing, building, testing, and pushing/submitting your code**i

You can run you can compile and run your code with the following commands:

```
make clean
make lab7-2
./lab7-2
```


2. **Test the program using your own data from your desk check. You can test your code against my unit test with the following commands:**

``` 
make test_lab7-2
./test_files/test_lab7-2
```

# Lab 7-3 Modify

1. **Change Lab7-1.cpp in the first comment to Lab7-3.cpp. Change the for statement to a while statement. Test the program using the following data: 76, 80, 100, 43, 68, 70, and 79.**

```
make clean
make lab7-3
./lab7-3
```
**You can also use the unit test for testing your code by running the following:** 
``` 
make test_lab7-3
./test_files/test_lab7-3
```

# Lab 7-4 What's Missing?

1. **Put the C++ instructions in the proper order, and then determine the one or more missing instructions. Test the program using the following monthly electric bills: 124.89, 110.65, 99.43, 100.35, and –1 (the sentinel value)**

```
make clean
make lab7-4
./lab7-4
```
**You can also use the unit test for testing your code by running the following:** 
``` 
make test_lab7-4
./test_files/test_lab7-4
```

# Lab 7-6 Debug

1. **Run the program. When you are prompted to enter a price, type 15.45, and press Enter. The “Next price:” prompt appears over and over again in the Command Prompt window, as shown in Figure 7-46. This is a result of the computer repeatedly processing the cout << “Next price: ”; statement contained in the body of the while loop, and it indicates that the program contains an endless (or infinite) loop. You can stop an endless loop by pressing Ctrl+c (press and hold down the Ctrl key as you tap the letter c, and then release both keys).  Debug the program and then test it appropriately.**

```
make clean
make lab7-6
./lab7-6
```
**You can also use the unit test for testing your code by running the following:** 
``` 
make test_lab7-6
./test_files/test_lab7-6
```

# Homework 7-16

**In this exercise, you will modify the tip program shown earlier in Figure 7-31. Change the for statement to a while statement. Save and then run the program. Test the program using 90.50 as the restaurant bill. The three tips should appear as shown earlier in Figure 7-32.**

```
make clean
make hw7-16
./hw7-16
```
**You can also use the unit test for testing your code by running the following:** 
``` 
make test_hw7-16
./test_files/test_hw7-16
```
